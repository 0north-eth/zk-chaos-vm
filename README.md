# zk-chaos-vm

A programmable entropy surface built to test the application of recursive collapse on systems.

This system simulates a deterministic loop influenced by non-linear entropy fluctuations.  
Each frame executes as a pseudo-ZX gate through a physics-stabilized interface.

### Ψ Core Mechanics

Let `S` = system state  
Let `T` = tick (frame progression)  
Let `ΔS` = change in state over time

We define:

ΔS = f(T) + e


Where `f(T)` represents expected structural flow and `e ∈ E` is emergent entropy injected per tick.  
The system strives for `ΔS → 0`, yet collapse is unavoidable as `e` exceeds stability thresholds.

At frame `Tₙ`, the system visualizes entropy saturation.

### ⌁ OBSERVE

- ZX-kernel interface  
- Layer-zero execution path  
- Instability encoded into state progression  
- Graphical proof of order | decay symmetry  
- Runtime inputs = non-linear ∴ loop behavior is emergent
